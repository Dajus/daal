                                    Carbon monoxide, also known as CO, is a very dangerous poisonous gas. Its danger is mainly due to its high toxicity and the fact that it does not smell, it is not colored in any way and has no taste. In the case of contact with this gas, there is a very rapid reduction in the transmission of oxygen in the blood, resulting in malaise, drowsiness and death. The affected person is usually unaware of their poisoning and remains in the affected area.

                                    Carbon monoxide is produced by the poor combustion of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels such as gases, heating oils and coal or wood used for heating or hot water. Poor combustion usually begins to occur when there is a malfunction in the heating appliance or when there is insufficient air supply to the appliance.

                                    Carbon monoxide poisoning is indicated in the early stages by gradual disorientation and inability to leave the affected area or call for help. Children and pets tend to be affected earlier than adults. In case of sleep poisoning, the victim does not wake up.

                                Intervention with a fire extinguisher during a fire must always be carried out in the direction of the wind and the ejection jet of extinguishing agent must always be directed to the source of the fire, or to burning objects - not to the flames, while it is necessary to constantly follow the fire. Keep a sufficient distance from fire, be careful not to transfer flames to undesirable places with the extinguishing agent jet or to get scalded when using water appliances. When extinguishing the fire, proceed from the bottom to the top (the flames usually go upwards) For powder fire extinguishers, it is recommended to extinguish intermittently. After extinguishing, be careful not to re-ignite.
